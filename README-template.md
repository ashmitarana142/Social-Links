## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid, Tailwind CSS



### What I learned

While working on this project, I learned how to effectively use Tailwind CSS to style components quickly and responsively. Tailwind's utility-first approach makes it easier to apply styles directly in the HTML, allowing for rapid development and iteration.


### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to delve deeper into Tailwind CSS to explore its more advanced features and utilities. I also aim to improve my proficiency in creating responsive layouts that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes.

### Useful resources

Tailwind CSS Documentation - This is an amazing resource which helped me understand the utility-first approach of Tailwind CSS.
Frontend Mentor - A great platform for practicing front-end development skills with real-world projects.
